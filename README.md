# module 5: work-day-scheduler

##Description

For module 5's challenge we were asked to create a work day scheduler. For this challenege we used moment.js for all the time elements, as well as used some jQuery to be able to simpify our code. This challenge helped solidfy my JavaScript knowledge and all the pieces slowly started to come together. This challenge was a fun one because it's something I could use in my everyday life. A common tool is a scheduling sheet, and something that people use everyday. During this challenge the colors changing for past present and future was somehting new, and a part that took me a little bit of time to figure out. This challeneg also helped solidify saving informtaiton to local stoarge and being able to refresh the page having the saved events still persist.
